## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 1

_working with objects_

* * *

### Description
This program provides a class, Point, which represents points in 3D space. One can enter the coordinates of a point into an object of this class by calling its setX, setY, and setZ methods. One can also access the coordinates of said point by using the getX, getY, and getZ methods. The program can do distance calculations on two points via the distanceTo method and area calculations on a triangle of three points via the computeArea function.

Currently, the main function is set up to do tests on the rest of the program. It uses the files ErrorContext.cpp, ErrorContext.h, PointTests.cpp, and PointTests.h to do so, and those files are only necessary to run said tests.

### Compiler
This program was developed, tested, and run on Visual Studio 2015. It was not tested on other compilers, but has a CMakeLists.txt file for use on CLion or similar compilers that use this file.
